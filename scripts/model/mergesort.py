'''
Basic steps for merge sort algorithm
1. Divide and conquer approach: it uses the divide and conquer paradigm. it means
  that the initial problem is divided into associated subproblems, where a solution
  can be applied recursively to each subproblem. The final solution to the larger
  problem is a combination of the solutions to the subproblems.
2. Divide: continously break down the larger problem into smaller parts.
3. Conquer: solve each of the smaller parts by utilizing a function that's called recursively.
4. Combine: merge all solutions for all smaller parts into a single unified solution,
  which becomes the solution to the starting problem.
