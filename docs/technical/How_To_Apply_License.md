# How to apply a license of JetBrain IDEA products
JetBrains can support open source project by providing free All Products Pack and Team Tools licenses to use for the development of the project. If you are a project lead or a core contributor, you can fill out the [form](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/opensource?product=ALL) to request this support.

The basic requirement is that the project should be actively and consistently developed in the past six months, otherwise the automatic check should be failure.

According to the [requirements of our Open Source Program](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/opensource/#support), new code commits should have been submitted every month for at least the last six months before the application. Non-code contributions like readme, .txt, and markdown files, or Dependabot commits, do not count.
