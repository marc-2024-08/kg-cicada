### Data Product Hub 5.1.0 release 
**Release cycle**: 2024.08 - present Two weeks per iterator  
**Summary**: Support a comprehensive ACL conditions to access the data assets in the data mesh    
**Project List**:  
- Access control based on users or user groups for the data as product access  
Brief: This big Epic intend to provide fune-tune access control based on users or user groups for the data assets. There are composed of multiple tasks to complete this Epic. The 1st task was completed already by Indian folks lead by me, and the 2nd task are in design phase, I'm discussing the architecutre, scenarios, use cases with PM, Architecure located in NA.

### Data Product Hub 5.0.1/2/3 release 2024.05 - 2024.07
Summary:  
Project List:  
- Service ID replacement for relevant data assets
Summary: It's security enhancement. The service ID and it's api key as credential are used to communicate between services in DPH instance. They are created at DPH instance initiaulization. At meantime, users can easily delete it by accident. Once the credential is lost, lots of basic fundational in DPH would be lost as well.  
Archievement: I individually completed this project within one week for design, two weeks for coding, and one week for unit testing.
