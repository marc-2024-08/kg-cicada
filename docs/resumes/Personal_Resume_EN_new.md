### Project List
#### IBM Data Product Hub release  
Data Product Hub is a new starship product arming to digital asset management platform in the data mesh area, it is built based on open cloud and private cloud in SaaS layer, make the data assets can be automatically, intellengently used by any category application, such as model training, data analysis, etc. Currently the product team spreads in North America, China, and Indian. Since 2023 the team spent one half year from the initial prototype design, first MVP until the final 1st release on July, 2024.  

**Release cycle** 2023.01 - present  
**Development cycle** Agile, two weeks per sprint, 3 or 4 sprints in total
**Summary** Led a 7 person team in Indian, completed the 1st release using one half year and continue the development for several major/minor release

**Project List**  
- User ACL management including user, role, permission management. Support for million grade enterprise user currently
- The data assets import, allow customers load the data from various data sources. Support for 10+ data source, mainly include major database, Snowflake, Log, CSV, Plain Text, and URL
- The data asset preview, simply view the structure, non-structure desensitize data
- The data asset version control policy, contains pre-release and release version control
- The data asset definition, includes metadata definition, relationship definition, etc.
- The data asset lineage, construct the knowledge graph, lineage info based on the defined metadata information
- The semantic search combines with the knowledge graph, nlp model, bio-inspired model, etc. for the data assets

#### IBM Global Search Service
The search service is a common core service built in IBM Knowledge Catalog product to provide the search experience for raw data and governance data for customers using the global unique search bar in browser interface.

**Release cycle** 2019.06 - 2022.01
**Development cycle** Agile, two weeks per sprint, 4 sprints for minor release, 8 sprints for major release
**Summary** An unique search bar receives the query from customers directly. As a developer in China, collaborate with the team located in NA and Indian working on feature design, coding, unit test, deployment in agile manner. In three half years, delivered multiple release on IBM public cloud and IBM private cloud solution successfully.

**Project List**
- Key-value search, customers can use key-value pair to search the data assets
- A customizable ES query clause to expand the query capability and improve the relevant and precise in search result
- Semantic search. based on the knowledge graph, provide a light query engine to add more relationship in the query context from the customers. In technology using JanusGraph API implemented the query engine including SPARKQL query construct, transformation, query execution optimization. In the meantime, proactive evaluate the Neo4J capability instead
- RabbitMQ events optimization in consumer side
