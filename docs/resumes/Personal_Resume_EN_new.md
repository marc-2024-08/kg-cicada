- The data asset preview, simply view the structure, non-structure desensitize data
- The data asset version control policy, contains pre-release and release version control
- The data asset definition, includes metadata definition, relationship definition, etc.
- The data asset lineage, construct the knowledge graph, lineage info based on the defined metadata information
- The semantic search combines with the knowledge graph, nlp model, bio-inspired model, etc. for the data assets

#### IBM Global Search Service
The search service is a common core service built in IBM Knowledge Catalog product to provide the search experience for raw data and governance data for customers using the global unique search bar in browser interface.
